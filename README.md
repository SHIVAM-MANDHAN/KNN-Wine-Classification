# KNN Model on Wine Dataset

This repository contains a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) machine learning model trained on the Wine dataset. The Wine dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that is commonly used for classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a KNN model that can accurately predict the class of a wine sample based on its chemical composition. The Wine dataset contains 13 features (chemical measurements) and 3 classes (wine cultivars).

The KNN model is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. In this project, we will be using the KNN algorithm for classification. The KNN algorithm works by finding the k nearest neighbors to a given data point and then predicting the class of that data point based on the class of its neighbors.

## Results

The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 82.33% on the Wine dataset. This indicates that the model is able to accurately predict the class of a wine sample based on its chemical composition.

## Conclusion

In this project, we built a KNN model on the Wine dataset and achieved an accuracy of 82.33%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the KNN algorithm for classification tasks, and the importance of choosing appropriate hyperparameters for the model.
